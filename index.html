					<dd>	“As I’ve learned about blockchain, I’ve started to see where it connects to user
						experience<br> design. Translating some of the technology components into what we, as UX
						designers, <br>are used to working with has helped me understand how we can contribute to a
						blockchain-<br>based project—something we’ll likely need to know how to do in the not-so-distant future.”<br>

					<dd>	“Hope for blockchain UX
						UX may not be getting enough attention from blockchain <br>companies at present,
						but the opportunities for its implementation are not going unnoticed.<br> Next month,
						Justinien will host Cake and UX, an event in New York City dedicated to bringing <br>UX
						solutions to entrepreneurs in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.<p>
						One of the topics sure to be discussed is the need for user advocacy in blockchain <br>
						and other digital technology. “Why aren't there advocates for users — especially for<br>
						financial services and user data — in the digital world?” Justinien asks. "We can design <br>
						for trust and, in turn, know that a product or service can actually be accessible to the average person.”
